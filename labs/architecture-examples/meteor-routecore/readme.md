## Implementation

This app is contained within a single jsx file.  The code in this file is shared between the client and the server.

HTML5 routing is used, rather than hash based routing, as that is what RouteCore uses for routing.


## Running

Install Meteor
```bash
 $ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Install Meteorite
```bash
 $ npm install -g meteorite
```

Run the app
```bash
 $ mrt
```
